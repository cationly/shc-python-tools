Python tools for calculating the spectral heat current from the data produced by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation using LAMMPS (http://lammps.sandia.gov) software. The relevant theory was published in:

2) K. S채채skilahti, J. Oksanen, S. Volz, and J. Tulkki, Phys. Rev. B 91, 115426 (2015).

These codes are meant to help anyone interested in implementing the spectral heat current calculations for their own applications. If you want to use the codes for research purposes, please cite the above-mentioned publications and let me know.

shc-tools/SHCPostProc.py: Class for performing the post-processing

shc-tools/calcFC.py: Class for calculating the force constants (note that the definition of the "left" and "right" interfaces must be the same in the NEMD simulation and in the calculation of the force constants)

calcSHC.py: Script demonstrating how the post-processing class is used and how the data could be saved to file

shc-tools/compactify_vels.cpp: C++ script for formatting the LAMMPS's dump velocity file into a more easily readable column file. The program can be compiled by running make in shc-tools folder (if g++ is found, otherwise modify Makefile such that appropriate compiler is defined in variable CC).

example/: Self-contained example for calculating the spectral heat current flowing across a slab of amorphous Si. The script to be run is called "silicon_example.py", and it (i) prepares the box of atoms, (ii) calls LAMMPS to perform the quenching procedure contained in LAMMPS input file "quench_Si.lmp", (iii) calls LAMMPS to perform the actual NEMD calculation for a-Si (amorphous_interface.lmp.), and (iv) performs the post-processing using the tools calcSHC.py and calcFC.py.

Note that calling LAMMPS from Python requires that you have linked LAMMPS as a dynamically shared library "liblammps.so", which must be found in the environment ($LD_LIBRARY_PATH). Python must also find the interface "lammps.py" in $PYTHONPATH. Calling LAMMPS from Python is described in detail in the LAMMPS manual: http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Section_python.html.
